TERMINATING AND CONNECTING ELECTRICAL WIRING
      CONTRACTOR AND INDICATOR
Conductor- are materials that permit electrons to flow freely
Indicator- one materials that blocks the flow at electrons

<h3 style="background-color:deepskyblue"> WIRES AND CABLES</h3>
<p><strong>WIRES</strong> - a single conductor (materials most commonly being are copper and aluminum.)</p>
<p><strong>CABLES</strong> - is two or more insulator wire crapped in one jacket.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:deepskyblue">TYPES OF ELECTRICAL WIRES</h3>
<p><strong>SOLID WIRES</strong> - is a single conductor that is either barc or insulated.</p>
<p><strong>STRANDED WIRES</strong> - composed of inquiry this strands together.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:deepskyblue">Types of electrical cables</h3>
<p><strong>1. Twisted pairs</strong> - two cables twisted accross each other. 
<br><strong>2. Multi-conductor cable</strong> - two or more conductors that are insulated to each other.
<br><strong>3. Coaxial cable</strong> - composed of inner solid conductor that is protected by an insulating layer.
<br><strong>4. Fiber optic cable</strong> - composed of many micro fibers.</p>


       <h3 style="background-color:deepskyblue">WIRE TERMINATION</h3>
<p><strong>ELECTRICAL TERMINATION</strong> - is an electrical industry term used to describe the specific point out which a conductive device such as wire or cable. A wire typically ends or terminates, at the terminal block: but the electricity or c signal may be passed out of the terminal connectors.</p> 

       <h3 style="background-color:deepskyblue">WIRE TERMINATOR METHOD</h3> 
<p><strong>SOLDERING</strong> - is a process by which two or more metal items are joined together by melting and then following a filler  metal into joined the filter metal having  a relatively low melting point.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:deepakyblue">WIRE TERMINATION METHOD</h3>
<p><strong>Crimping</strong> - is joining piecess of metal other duetile material (usually a wire and a metal) by performing one or both or than to hold the other.</p>

   <br>1. efficiency 
   <br>2. share info or lessly
   <br>3. increase productivity</p> 
<p><strong><u>TYPES OF NETWORKING (MATERIALS)</u></strong>
   <br>1. wired networking 
   <br>2. wireless</p> 
<p><strong><u>TYPES OF NETWORKING (AREA)</u></strong>
   <br>1. LAN- local are network
   <br>2. WAN- wide are network 
   <br>3. PAN- personal are network 
   <br>4. MAN- metropolitan area network</p>
