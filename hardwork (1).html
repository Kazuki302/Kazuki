<h3 style="background-color:DeepSkyBlue">OHS</h3>
<p><strong>Personal safety while working along with PC'S</strong><br>   
1. Always disconnect your system Before Beginning WORK.<br>2. Always ground or discharge yourself Before touching anypart of the computer<br>3. While working inside your computer, do not attempt to service the computer except as explained in this guide and elsewhere in product documentations.
<br>4. Always follow the instruction closely<br>5. Do not work on components that are plugged into their power source<br>6. Work in a clear area, away from children and pets.<br>7. Keep liquids well away from the working area<br>8. Be organized
<br>9. If you Have a long Hair tie it Back and keep it Out of the way<br>10. Remove all Jewelry when working inside any computer related equipment.<br>11. Keep small items  away from the pc<br>12. Don't work in carpeted area
<br>13. Wear anti static wrist strap to protect FROM ESD<br>14. Make sure that the Place where the computer is kept is dust Free as dust can harm the system<br>15. Make sure that the room has good ventilition and won't be very hot.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:DeepSkyBlue"> Hardware Tools</h3>
<p><strong>Hard Tools are grouped into these four categories:</strong><br>1. Electro-Static Discharge(ESD) tools<br>2. Hand Tools<br>3. Cleaning Tools<br>4. Diagnostic Tools

<h3 style="background-color:DeepSkyBlue">Examples of ESD Tools</h3>
1. Anti-static wrist strap - ESD wrist strap, or ground bracelet is an antistatic device used to prevent electrostatic discharge (ESD) by safely grounding a person working on electronic equipment.<br>
2. Anti-static mat - used to stand on or place hardware on to prevent static electricity from building up.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:DeepSkyBlue">Hand Tools</h3>
<p>*A hand tool is a device for performing work on a material or a physical system using only hands. The hand tools can be manually used employing force, or electrically powered, using electrical current.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:DeepSkyBlue">What Is 7s</h3>
<p>* 7s is a systematized approach to organize work areas, keep rules and standards, and maintain the discipline needed to do a good job.<br>* It Utilizes workplace organization and work simplification
techniques to make work easier, faster, cheaper, safer, and more effective.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:DeepSkyBlue">5s</h3>
<p><strong>Seiri;</strong> Sort, Clearing, Classify.<br>
<strong>Seiton;</strong> Straighten, Simplify, Set in order, Configure.<br>
<strong>Seiso;</strong> Sweep, shine, Scrub, Clean and Check<br>
<strong>Seiketsu;</strong> Standardize, stabilize, Conformity<br>
<strong>Shitsuke;</strong> Sustain, self discipline, custom and practice</p>

<h3 style="background-color:deepskyblue">2s</h3>

<h3 style="background-color:deepskyblue">Meaning:</h3>
<p><strong>* Seire or Sort</strong> is the first step in 5S, it refers to the sorting of the clutter from the other items within the work area that are actually needed. This stage requires the team to remove all items that clearly do not belong in the working area and only leave those that are required for the processes in question.
<br><strong>* Seiton or Straighten</strong> is the process of taking the required items that are remaining after the removal of clutter and arranging them in an efficient manner through the use of ergonomic principles and ensuring that every item “has a place and that everything is in its 
<br><strong>* Seiso or Sweep</strong> is the thorough cleaning of the area, tools, machines and other equipment to ensure that everything is returned to a “nearly new” status. This will ensure that any non-conformity stands out; such as an oil leak from a machine onto a bright, newly painted clean floor.
<br><strong>* Seiketsu or Standardize</strong> is the process of ensuring that what we have done within the first three stages of 5S become standardized; that is we ensure that we have common standards and ways of working. Standard work is one of the most important principles of Lean manufacturing.
<br><strong>* Shitsuke or Sustain</strong> ensuring that the company continue to continually improve using the previous stages of 5S, maintain housekeeping, and conduct audits and so forth. 5S should become part of the culture of the business and the responsibility of everyone in the organization.
